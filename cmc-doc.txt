CMC System Architecture Documentation

1. Introduction

This document provides an overview of the CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Clinical) system architecture implemented on the Workiva platform. The purpose is to guide new users on how data flows through the system, ensuring smooth integration, collaboration, and compliance in CMC-related processes.

The architecture involves multiple components, including Databricks, Wdata, and Wdesk, to manage data efficiently and generate reports with automated processes.

2. System Overview

The CMC system leverages Workiva’s cloud-based platform to streamline data flow, automate reporting, and facilitate compliance. The system integrates various data sources, processes them through Databricks and Wdata, and generates structured reports using Wdesk.

Key System Components:
    1.    Databricks: Processes and pushes CMC data.
    2.    Wdata: Stores and retrieves data for reporting.
    3.    Wdesk: Manages report templates and automates document generation.
    4.    Python Automation: Fills reports dynamically based on fetched data.

3. Data Flow and System Components

The architecture consists of two main stages: Data Processing & Storage and Report Generation.

3.1 Data Processing & Storage
    1.    Data Push from CTDA to Databricks:
    •    The system receives CMC data from CTDA (Centralized Data Analysis).
    •    Databricks processes and stores this data.
    •    A push event triggers the transfer of processed data from Databricks to Wdata Datamodel.
    2.    Wdata Query and Retrieval:
    •    SQL queries fetch specific CMC data from Wdata Datamodel.
    •    The data retrieved contains critical information such as Product Name, Dosage, and Results.
    •    The extracted data is structured in a tabular format.

3.2 Report Generation
    1.    CMC Report Template Management in Wdesk:
    •    A CMC Report Template is uploaded into Wdesk Folder.
    •    Users configure this template based on business requirements.
    2.    Template Duplication & Automation:
    •    A template replica is created from the configured template.
    •    A Python script automation fills the template with the fetched data.
    3.    Final Report Generation:
    •    The automated process results in a Filled Report, which can be used for regulatory submissions, analysis, and compliance.

4. Workiva Platform Features Used

The system architecture utilizes the following Workiva platform features:

4.1 Wdata for Data Management
    •    Data Connectivity: Integrates data from multiple sources (CTDA, Databricks).
    •    SQL Queries: Enables structured data retrieval.
    •    Dynamic Tables: Automatically updates tables with new data.

4.2 Wdesk for Report Handling
    •    Real-Time Collaboration: Teams can configure templates and generate reports simultaneously.
    •    Document Automation: Templates are auto-filled with retrieved data, reducing manual effort.
    •    Audit Trail & Version Control: Ensures compliance by tracking all report modifications.

4.3 Security & Compliance
    •    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Users have restricted access based on their roles.
    •    Data Encryption: Ensures secure storage and transmission of sensitive CMC data.

5. User Interaction and Workflow

5.1 Onboarding and Access
    •    New users are granted access based on roles (Data Analyst, Report Manager, Compliance Officer).
    •    Training includes navigating Wdata queries, Wdesk templates, and Python automation.

5.2 Data Entry and Updates
    •    Users manually upload CMC data or rely on automated push events.
    •    Wdata maintains structured records that can be queried at any time.

5.3 Reporting and Compliance
    •    Reports are generated using pre-configured templates.
    •    Python scripts automate data population, reducing manual errors.
    •    Audit logs track report modifications for compliance and verification.

6. Future Considerations
    •    Scalability: The system can accommodate more data sources and additional reporting modules.
    •    Automation Enhancements: Future updates may integrate AI-powered analysis and predictive reporting.
    •    User Feedback Integration: Continuous improvements based on feedback from CMC analysts and regulatory teams.

7. Conclusion

This CMC system architecture, built on the Workiva platform, efficiently manages CMC data processing and report generation. It leverages Databricks for data processing, Wdata for structured storage, Wdesk for document management, and Python automation for seamless report generation.
